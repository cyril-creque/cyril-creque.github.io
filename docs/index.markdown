I am a PhD candidate in Marc Kamionkowski's group at Johns Hopkins University. Prior to this, I was an undergraduate at MIT. My research interests involve the use of observationally informed cosmology, with forays into astrophysics and astronomy, in order to extract information about our Universe on all scales. I am currently focused on building theoretical and statistical frameworks in order to investigate the nature of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos and active galactic nuclei variability.
