I am a PhD candidate in Marc Kamionkowski's group at Johns Hopkins University. Prior to this, I was an undergraduate at MIT. My research interests involve the use of observationally-informed cosmology, with forays into astrophysics and astronomy, in order to extract information about our Universe on all scales. I am currently focused on building theoretical and statistical frameworks in order to investigate the nature of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos and active galactic nuclei variability.

Outside of physics, I enjoy listening to music and lifting weights. In general, I am always open to talking about composition, sound design, xenharmonics, or optimizing strength and hypertrophy. If interested in seeing what I listen to, you can browse my <a href = "https://last.fm/user/Cyrilcs">last.fm</a>.
